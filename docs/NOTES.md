# Test  coverage

- Improve \Drupal\Tests\schemadotorg_ui\Kernel\SchemaDotOrgUiApiTest
- Create SchemaDotOrgUiMappingForm kernel test.
  - Check all functionality.
- JavaScript test coverage for UI and Report.
- FormValidation test coverage for SchemaDotOrgFormTrait

# Best Practices

- If two properties can address similar use-cases, use the more common property.
  - For example, Place can have an 'image' and 'photo'.
    It is simpler to use 'image'.

- For high-level types, which are inherited from, we want to keep the
  default properties as simple as possible.

- For specific and important types, including Recipe, we should be as specific
  as needed with the default properties.

# TBD

- Should you be able to map the same field to multiple properties?
  - body => description and disambiguatingDescription

- How do we handle sub-values (i.e. body.summary)?
  - Token field?

- How to handle translations for imported data?
  - Include descriptions added via the schemadotorg_descriptions.module

- How can we validate the generated JSON-LD?
