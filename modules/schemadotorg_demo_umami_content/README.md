Introduction
------------

The Schema.org Blueprints Demo Umami Content module imports the content from the 
Umami demo installation profile into a demo of Schema.org Blueprints.


Features
--------

- Create Schema.org type mappings for Umami article, page, and recipe 
  content types.
- Imports Umami content. 
  (@see /core/profiles/demo_umami/modules/demo_umami_content)
- Applies mapping from Umami fields to Schema.org fields.


Notes
-----

The Schema.org Blueprint Demo Standard module deliberately tries not to contain
a lot of exported configuration files. This make it easier to maintain this 
module's configuration by allowing the dependencies to make configuration 
changes and improvements as needed without impacting this demo.
